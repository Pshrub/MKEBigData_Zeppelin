# MKEBigData_Zeppelin
Presentation, Zeppelin notebook and associated data files.

The files in this repo are all of the files from a presentation
I gave to the [MKEBigData](http://www.meetup.com/MKE-Big-Data/events/230722728/) meetup group on 7 June 2016. I used [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/download.html) version 0.5.6.

The presentation files are the slides on Apache Zeppelin.
* MKEBigData_June2016.odp
* MKEBigData_June2016.ppt

The two csv files used in the data analysis covered in the notebook.
* MPROP2007DEC.csv.gz
* MPROP2005DEC_v3.csv.gz

The exported Zeppelin notebook, which should be easily imported into a Zeppelin server.
* MKEPropertyData.json file

<b>NB</b> After importing the notebook into Zeppelin, unzip the two csv files, store them locally, and edit the notebook to change the paths where the files are pulled from.
