# MKEBigData_Zeppelin
Presentation, Zeppelin notebook and associated data files.

The files in this repo are all of the files from a presentation
I gave to the MKEBigData meetup group on 7 June 2016.

The presentation file (MKEBigData_June2016.odp) are the slides on Apache Zeppelin.
The two .gz files (MPROP2007DEC.csv.gz and MPROP2005DEC_v3.csv.gz)
are the two csv files used in the data analysis covered in the notebook.

The MKEPropertyData.json file is the exported Zeppelin notebook, and should be
easily imported into a Zeppelin server. I used Zeppelin version 0.5.6.
